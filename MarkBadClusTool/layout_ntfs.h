 * COLLATION_FILE_NAME - Collate file names as Unicode strings. The collation
 *    is done very much like COLLATION_UNICODE_STRING. In fact I have no idea
 *    what the difference is. Perhaps the difference is that file names
 *    would treat some special characters in an odd way (see
 *    unistr.c::ntfs_collate_names() and unistr.c::legal_ansi_char_array[]
 *    for what I mean but COLLATION_UNICODE_STRING would not give any special
 *    treatment to any characters at all, but this is speculation.
 * COLLATION_NTOFS_ULONG - Sorting is done according to ascending DWORD key
 *    values. E.g. used for $SII index in FILE_Secure, which sorts by
 *    security_id (DWORD).
 * COLLATION_NTOFS_SID - Sorting is done according to ascending SID values.
 *    E.g. used for $O index in FILE_Extend/$Quota.
 * COLLATION_NTOFS_SECURITY_HASH - Sorting is done first by ascending hash
 *    values and second by ascending security_id values. E.g. used for $SDH
 *    index in FILE_Secure.
 * COLLATION_NTOFS_ULONGS - Sorting is done according to a sequence of ascending
 *    DWORD key values. E.g. used for $O index in FILE_Extend/$ObjId, which
 *    sorts by object_id (16-byte), by splitting up the object_id in four
 *    DWORD values and using them as individual keys. E.g. take the following
 *    two security_ids, stored as follows on disk:
 *        1st: a1 61 65 b7 65 7b d4 11 9e 3d 00 e0 81 10 42 59
 *        2nd: 38 14 37 d2 d2 f3 d4 11 a5 21 c8 6b 79 b1 97 45
 *    To compare them, they are split into four DWORD values each, like so:
 *        1st: 0xb76561a1 0x11d47b65 0xe0003d9e 0x59421081
 *        2nd: 0xd2371438 0x11d4f3d2 0x6bc821a5 0x4597b179
 *    Now, it is apparent why the 2nd object_id collates after the 1st: the
 *    first DWORD value of the 1st object_id is less than the first DWORD of
 *    the 2nd object_id. If the first DWORD values of both object_ids were
 *    equal then the second DWORD values would be compared, etc.

 * There are three different cases of how a compression block of X clusters
 * can be stored:
 *
 *   1) The data in the block is all zero (a sparse block):
 *      This is stored as a sparse block in the runlist, i.e. the runlist
 *      entry has length = X and lcn = -1. The mapping pairs array actually
 *      uses a delta_lcn value length of 0, i.e. delta_lcn is not present at
 *      all, which is then interpreted by the driver as lcn = -1.
 *      NOTE: Even uncompressed files can be sparse on NTFS 3.0 volumes, then
 *      the same principles apply as above, except that the length is not
 *      restricted to being any particular value.
 *
 *   2) The data in the block is not compressed:
 *      This happens when compression doesn't reduce the size of the block
 *      in clusters. I.e. if compression has a small effect so that the
 *      compressed data still occupies X clusters, then the uncompressed data
 *      is stored in the block.
 *      This case is recognised by the fact that the runlist entry has
 *      length = X and lcn >= 0. The mapping pairs array stores this as
 *      normal with a run length of X and some specific delta_lcn, i.e.
 *      delta_lcn has to be present.
 *
 *   3) The data in the block is compressed:
 *      The common case. This case is recognised by the fact that the run
 *      list entry has length L < X and lcn >= 0. The mapping pairs array
 *      stores this as normal with a run length of X and some specific
 *      delta_lcn, i.e. delta_lcn has to be present. This runlist entry is
 *      immediately followed by a sparse entry with length = X - L and
 *      lcn = -1. The latter entry is to make up the vcn counting to the
 *      full compression block size X.
 *
 * In fact, life is more complicated because adjacent entries of the same type
 * can be coalesced. This means that one has to keep track of the number of
 * clusters handled and work on a basis of X clusters at a time being one
 * block. An example: if length L > X this means that this particular runlist
 * entry contains a block of length X and part of one or more blocks of length
 * L - X. Another example: if length L < X, this does not necessarily mean that
 * the block is compressed as it might be that the lcn changes inside the block
 * and hence the following runlist entry describes the continuation of the
 * potentially compressed block. The block would be compressed if the
 * following runlist entry describes at least X - L sparse clusters, thus
 * making up the compression block length as described in point 3 above. (Of
 * course, there can be several runlist entries with small lengths so that the
 * sparse entry does not follow the first data containing entry with
 * length < X.)
 *
 * NOTE: At the end of the compressed attribute value, there most likely is not
 * just the right amount of data to make up a compression block, thus this data
 * is not even attempted to be compressed. It is just stored as is, unless
 * the number of clusters it occupies is reduced when compressed in which case
 * it is stored as a compressed compression block, complete with sparse
 * clusters at the end.

 * - The attribute list attribute contains one entry for each attribute of

 * name (if present), third by instance number. The extents of one

 * It is not allowed to have two attributes with all sorting keys equal.
 * - Further restrictions:
 *    - If not resident, the vcn to lcn mapping array has to fit inside the
 *      base mft record.
 *    - The attribute list attribute value has a maximum size of 256kb. This
 *      is imposed by the Windows cache manager.
 * - Attribute lists are only used when the attributes of mft record do not
 * fit inside the mft record despite all attributes (that can be made
 * non-resident) having been made non-resident. This can happen e.g. when:
 *    - File has a large number of hard links (lots of file name

 *    - The first "S" is the literal character 'S' identifying the following

 * stream ($SDS).
 *
 * Every unique security descriptor is assigned a unique security identifier
 * (security_id, not to be confused with a SID). The security_id is unique for
 * the NTFS volume and is used as an index into the $SII index, which maps
 * security_ids to the security descriptor's storage location within the $SDS
 * data attribute. The $SII index is sorted by ascending security_id.
 *
 * A simple hash is computed from each security descriptor. This hash is used
 * as an index into the $SDH index, which maps security descriptor hashes to
 * the security descriptor's storage location within the $SDS data attribute.
 * The $SDH index is sorted by security descriptor hash and is stored in a B+
 * tree. When searching $SDH (with the intent of determining whether or not a
 * new security descriptor is already present in the $SDS data stream), if a
 * matching hash is found, but the security descriptors do not match, the
 * search in the $SDH index is continued, searching for a next matching hash.
 *
 * When a precise match is found, the security_id corresponding to the security
 * descriptor in the $SDS attribute is read from the found $SDH index entry and
 * is stored in the $STANDARD_INFORMATION attribute of the file/directory to
 * which the security descriptor is being applied. The $STANDARD_INFORMATION
 * attribute is present in all base mft records (i.e. in all files and
 * directories).
 *
 * If a match is not found, the security descriptor is assigned a new unique
 * security_id and is added to the $SDS data attribute. Then, entries
 * referencing the this security descriptor in the $SDS data attribute are
 * added to the $SDH and $SII indexes.
